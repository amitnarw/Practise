Using 2 ways =

REDIRECT A STATIC PAGE =
1. Using redirect component from "next/navigation" library
Do this on the page.js file of the route that we want to redirect to some other router.

import { redirect } from "next/navigation";

export default function Page(){
    redirect("/");
    return(
        <h1>This is a demo page</h1>
    )
}

Now this Page will be redirected to "/" whenever a user tries to access this route.

2. By config file 

const nextConfig = {
    redirects:async() => {
        return [
            {
                source: "/demo",        (From where to redirect)
                destination: "/",       (Redirect to which route)
                permanent: false       
            }
        ]
    }
}

permanent: false
This will tell Google bots that this redirect is not permanent and developer is only temporarily 
doing this because of some work on this "demo" page.
If we make this 
permanent: true
then Google will think this is permanent (in case this page/route is not available anymore)
and Google bots will not index this page for SEO.



REDIRECT A DYNAMIC PAGE =

const nextConfig = {
    redirects:async() => {
        return [
            {
                source: "/users/:id",
                destination: "/",
                permanent: false
            }
        ]
    }
}
