In Next.js we have the same types of CSS as in React.js.

Global CSS = 
In global CSS we can set a style globally for all elements of the same kind. Meaning if we want to
set the same style for all the h1 elements in our code we can do it by using Global CSS.

Inline CSS =
This is element-specific, so it will only apply to those elements where we are using it. And
this inline CSS has priority over global CSS, so if there is a style that is common in both
inline and global, the inline one will be applied.

Module CSS =
Sometimes when we use the same style name in different CSS files and import those style files
in the same JS file, then these files will conflict with each other in their functioning.
To solve this issue we can use modular CSS.
Here we import CSS like an object. By doing this we can still import different style files
in the same JS file but now these files will not conflict in their functioning.

For this, we have to rename the CSS files and add the "module" keyword in the name.
style1.css will be changed to style1.module.css


Conditional CSS =
We can use useState hook for conditional CSS.
