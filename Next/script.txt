Script component is used to load third-party scripts. This is different from the script tag that
we found in HTML because the HTML tag will load a script in the whole project, which can reduce
the performance of the web app.
Also, we may not need that script in our whole project and only need it in some of the
components or only one component. For this, we need a script component in Next.js.

Script component will only load that script in the component in which we imported it in.
