Next.js already has a 404/not-found page if we try to access a URL that is not available.
But this is a basic page that only shows 404 messages.
To make it useful or add additional things, we have to make our own 404 page.

We made a layout.js page (which is common for all pages inside that folder in which
layout.js is present) or page.js (where we save our work/UI), just like these, we have
to use the same name for every 404 page, which is "not-found.js".
And this file will only be used for showing 404/not-found pages. And just like with 
layout.js and page.js we have to make a similarly named file for every route/URL, we
have to make a similarly named file for a 404 page for every route/URL or we can make a
common 404 file for every route.

const notFound = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Not found</p>
    </div>
  )
}

export default notFound;

Everything else will be handled by Next.js.
If we made this page directly in the src/app folder, then this 404 page will be treated as
a global 404 page. This means a 404 page will be shown if we try to access a URL/route
after any route.
So, if we try to access 
localhost:3000/first/first1/ABC OR localhost:3000/abc
in both cases, we will see the same 404 page. 
But if we want to show a different 404 page in a route that is not available after "first"
OR "first/first1" then here we first have to make a similar folder like we made in 
catch-all folder.
[...not-found] (folder name can be anything)
Inside this folder, we have to make a file named "page.js".
In this file, we can make our separate 404-page UI.
