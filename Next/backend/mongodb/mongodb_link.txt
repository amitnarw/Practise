First, we have to put the MongoDB link in a file usually named "db.js".
This file will be in a folder named "lib" under src/app.

- This is what we have to write inside this file =
export const connectionStr = "mongodb://localhost:27017/productDB"; (Here, productDB is database name)

- After this, we have to make a folder named "model" inside the "lib" folder. This is where we save
the schema (structure) of the table/collection in which we save our data.
We will make a file inside this "model" folder named "product.js" and this is where we will
make schema, like this =

import mongoose from "mongoose";

const productModel = new mongoose.Schema({
    name: String,
    price: Number,
    company: String,
    color: String,
    category: String
});

export const Product = mongoose.models.products || mongoose.model("products", productModel);
