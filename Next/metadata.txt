Metadata is a set of data that describes and gives information about other data like a website.
A website is also where we have lots of data on different pages and to describe a website data
in short for SEO we use metadata. Metadata will improve SEO and shareability over the internet.
There are 2 ways to add metadata to a website =
1. Config-based
2. File-based

1. Config-based =
We can add a static metadata or a dynamic one. Static metadata is useful where the page is static
and the information is also will stay the same, like on the home page.
Dynamic data is useful when we have to change the whole info of a page like a different post page
or product page.

STATIC METADATA
- We can set metadata in the layout.js file as well as on the page.js file. But the metadata
we set on the page.js file will have priority and will replace the metadata that we getting from 
the layout.js file.
It's better if we use static metadata on the layout.js file because then it will be available
on all pages under that layout.js file.
Metadata is the in-built function of the Next.js, so we don't have to import it.

export const metadata = {                   (we can only use keyword metadata for this)
    title: "Title of the page",
    description: "Description of the page"
}

- We can make metadata like this for all static pages on a website. All pages will have
different metadata because of this.


DYNAMIC METADATA
To set dynamic metadata which requires dynamic values, we can't use normal "metadata"
keyword. For this, we have to use generateMetadata keyword which will fetch metadata.

export function generateMetadata(){
    return{
        title: "Title of the page",
        description: "Description of the page"
    }
}

- We can also use parameters in this function and get values related to this parameter from
the API.

- There is a property called open graph, which is a protocol that controls what content to
display when sharing links on social media. If not found then social media will select a
random content to show about the link we shared.

export async function generateMetadata({ params }){
    let data = await fetchData();
    return{
        title: data[params.day[0]].title,
        description: data[params.day[0]].description,
        openGraph: {
            title: data[params.day[0]].title,
            description: data[params.day[0]].description,
            images: data[params.day[0]].images
        }
    }
}
