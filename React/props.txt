Props stand for properties.
Props are data that we can send or pass into react components like an argument using an HTML attribute.

function Call(props){
    return <h1>Call us at {props.number}</h1>
}

<Call number=1223345546 />

- We have to use 'props' keyword to get all the props that the component is receiving.

- We can even send props from one component to another.

- If we want to send a variable in props and not a string, then we have to warp it around curly brackets.

numb = 1234567809
<Call number={numb}>

- Same if we want to send an object.

obj = {
    one: 1234567890
    two: 9087654321
    three: 2348991238
}
<Call number={obj} />

- props are readonly, so if try to edit/modify them then we will get an error.

- We can pass more than 1 prop like this

<Call number={obj} alpha='abc'/>
