This will let us render selected children into a different part of the DOM.

{createPortal(children, domNode, key?)}

<div>
    <p>This is inside div</p>
    {createPortal(
        <p>This is also inside div but will render outside div</p>, document.body
    )}
</div>

- We can also make a function, through which we can make aby child component render to a different
part of the DOM. And we don't have to use the same code again and again.
