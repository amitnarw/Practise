Page routing is not there is create react app. For this generally we use react router.
To install we have to use =
npm -i react-router-dom
If we already have it installed, then we can install latest one =
npm -i react-router-dom@latest

- It's better if we create a separate folder, where we put different files for different pages.

Implementation =
First we have to import react router components
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";

Then we have to follow this order to use it

<BrowserRouter>
    <Routes>
        <Route path='/' element={<Layout />}>
            <Route index element={<Home />}>
            <Route path='contact' element={<Contact />}>
            <Route path='about' element={<About />}>
            <Route path='*' element={<NotFound />}>
        </Route>
    </Routes>
</BrowserRouter>

BrowserRouter have to be wrapped around the whole thing.
Then we have to do the same but inside BrowserRouter with Routes.
Path with '*' will catch all the undefined pages and show them only Not Found page, like for 404 page.

- It's a good practice to include navigation bar related things in Layout page.
And in this page we can use <a href=''> OR <Link> element to navigate to different page.
<a href=''> will refresh the whole page
<Link> will not refresh the page.

const Layout = () => {
    return(
        <>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
                    <li><Link to="/contact">Contact</Link></li>
                    <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
            <Outlet />          (Because we used Nested Route, to make it work we have to use Outlet)
        </>
    )
}

- If we used nested Route and didn't used <Outlet />. then it won't work.
