Link, NavLink and useNavigate all are imported from react-router-dom.

All do the same thing but the way they do is different. useNavigate is a hook which returns a
function which we can use to redirect to a page.

- Link and NavLink are declarative programming (describes WHAT the program does something).
- useNavigate is imperative programming (describe HOW the program does something).

Declarative = 
We declare what we want to happen. Components handle everything
<button><Link to="/pageName">Click</Link></button>
Here we are just telling the button to go to this page.

Imperative =
We issue a command to navigate now and we also tell them how to do it.
const navigate = useNavigate();
<button onClick={() => {navigate("/pageName")}}>Click</button>
Here we are telling the button to navigate on a page on click.

- Link and NavLink should be used in the Navigation bar.
- useNavigate should be used anywhere except in the Navigation bar.

- There is no method available in Link to go back to the previous page.
- In useNavigate we have a method to back to the previous page.

For this, we just have to write -1 in place of the page address.

const navigate = useNavigate();
<button onClick = {() = > {navigate(-1)}}>Go Back</button>
