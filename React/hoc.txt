Higher Order Component (HOC) is an advanced type of component of react.
In HOC we input a component and it output a modified component. 
This is used when we want to do something again and again but with some modification.
Because we have to use the same component everytime, it becomes time-consuming and also code becomes
lengthy. To solve this we can just use a single component and just pass the modification what we want
as a prop.

Ex = 
Suppose we want to show a counter but with different background color. For that we will make counter
function Child() and pass this function through a Higher order function function HOC() and in this HOC()
function we will pass props with different background colors.


function Parent(){

  return(
      <>
          <h1>HOC</h1>
          <HOC val={Child} color="red"/>
          <HOC val={Child} color="green"/>
          <HOC val={Child} color="grey"/>
      </>
  )
}

function HOC(props){
  return(
    <div style={{backgroundColor: props.color}}>
    <props.val />
    </div>
  )
}

function Child(){
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return(
    <>
      <p>Counter: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={()=>setCount(count+1)}>Change</button>
    </>
  )
};
