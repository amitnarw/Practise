We can style css in React using =
- Inline styling
- Using css stylesheets
- Using css modules

Inline styling =
Using inline attribute.
const Demo = () => {
    return(
        <> 
            <h1 style={{color: 'green'}}>Hello</h1>
        </>
    )
}

Here 2 curly brackets are used. The first one is because we write JSX inside curly brackets and
Second is because we write style on js object and objects also use {}.

- In React we have to use camelCase property names.
background-color will be backgroundColor

- Because we write style in a js object, we can write style in a separate variable outside return()
but inside the component.
const Demo = () => {
    const sty = {
        color: 'green'
    };
    return(
        <> 
            <h1 style={sty}>Hello</h1>
        </>
    )
}

Using css stylesheets =
We can create a separate css file and put/write all the styles we want.
Then we have to call this file in our application on that component which uses it.
Or just call/import this .css file in index.js or App.js files, because all of our
components will pass through these files.

import "./FileName.css"

Using css module =
.css files are global. These are not for a single component or a file. This causes name conflict. 
When we use a .css file in a parent component, then that file is also used in its child component and
if there are same names in both files then they will conflict with each other function. And only the
parent's .css file will work.
This also happens in 2 separate child components that are used on the same page or under the same component.
Here if both child components have the same style name, then they will conflict with each other.
Generally, the child component that we used first, its css will be applied to all the same name css. 
So if we use css module and we have the same names in both .css files, then still it won't conflict
each other functions.

- First, we have to create a new .css file or rename the old one into fileName.module.css
- Now import this .css file where we want to use it, like this
import sty from "../index.module.css"
- Now we have to write className at the element on which we want to use it like this using curly brackets
<h1 className={sty.head}>
'head' here is the class name which we used in .css file.
