We can use loops to render/show all values of a list.

- map()
Preferred way is using map().

function Main(){
  const ll = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four'];
  return(
    <>
      <h1>List</h1>
      <ul>
        {ll.map((x)=><li>{x}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}

- Keys
If we use keys, we can keep track of elements. So if an item is updated/removed, then only that item
will be re-rendered instead of the entire list. We can even use index as a key, as a last resort.
These keys needs to be unique, so that we can track every element. But keys can be duplicated globally.

{ll.map((x, i)=><li key={i}>{x}</li>)}
OR
{ll.map((x)=><li key={Math.random()}>{x}</li>)}

key={} value should be included in the tag of the element.
