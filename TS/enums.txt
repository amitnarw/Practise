Enum is a special class that represents a group of constants.
Enums is of 2 types string and number.

Numeric enums (This is default) =
By default first value in enum is 0 and just like index increment by 1.

- enum list {one, two, three, four};
console.log(list.three);
2

- Initialized numeric enums
We can set value of first numeric enum and it will auto increment from there.
enum list {one = 1, two, three, four};
console.log(list.three);
3

- Fully initialized numeric enums
We can also assign unique number values to each enum value. These will not increment automatically.
enum list {one=22, two=11, three=932, four=0};
console.log(list.three);
932

String enums =
Enums can also contain strings and these are more commonly used then numeric enums, because of it's
better readability and intent.

enum list {one='ok', two='hello', three='bye', four='new'};
console.log(list.three);
bye

We can mix both numeric and string enums, but it's not recommended.
