Ts Object types =

const obj: object = {name: 'demo', age: 40} (Here we assign obj type as object. But ts will think it as
empty object. So we can't use any of it's values.)
Above example will behaves like const obj ={}
const obj: {name:string, dob:number, married:boolean} = {name:'demo', dob:12-12-2020, married:true}

- Infer
const obj = {name:'demo'}

- Optional properties
We have give value to every property, or else it will give error.
const obj: {name:string, dob:number, married:boolean} = {name:'demo', dob:12-12-2020}
Error: 'married' is missing in type.

To solve this we can make this property optional by using ? at the end of property name.
const obj: {name:string, dob:number, married?:boolean} = {name:'demo', dob:12-12-2020}
No error now.

- Index signatures
Objects without defined properties.
const obj: {[index: string]: number} = {}
obj.score = 50;
console.log(obj.score)
50

obj.name = '50';
Error: Type string is not assignable to type number.
