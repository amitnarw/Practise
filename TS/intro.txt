TypeScript = JavaScript + type syntax
Syntactical superset of js, which adds static typing.
Js is llosly typed language, so it can be difficult to understand what types of data are being
passed around. Like in a function parameter and variable. 
Ts specify type of data being passed around and can report error if types don't match.
In js if we pass a string in place of number, no error will be reported, but in ts error will be reported.
Ts uses compile time type checking, so it checks specified type before running code and not while code
is running. Ts converts into js, meaning ts can be run where js is running.

To use typescript we first have to install it. 
npm install -g typescript
We can check our install by
tsc --version
To run ts
tsc fileName
This will create a .js file. Now we have to run this .js file.
node fileName
We also have to make a tsconfig.json file, to use ts in vscode. Then press ctrl+space to fill this file
with prefilled info, which will be used to run ts.
In js file, types will be removed and let will be converted into var.

Commonly used primitive in ts = boolean, number and string
Less used primitive in ts = bigint, symbol

Type assignment =
- Explicit = Writing the type. Easier to read and more intentional.
let name: string = 'demo';

- Implicit = TypeScript will guess the type, based on the assigned value. When typescript guess the type,
it's called infer. These are short, faster to type and often used when developing and testing.
let name = 'demo';

Ts may not infer properly everytime, in those cases it will set type to any, which disabled type 
checking. 
let val = JSON.parse('22');
console.log(typeof val);
tsc fileName (This will create a .js file)
node fileName (This will run .js file)

Ts special types = These may not refer to any specific type of data.
- any 
This will disable type checking and will allow all types to be used.
But ts will not able to give any type safety and tools which rely on type data will not work.
So it should be avoided.

- unknown
Ts will prevent using unknown types. This is an safer alternative to any. This is used when we don't
know the type of data. To add a type later we have to cast it, meaning have to use 'as' keyword for
casting.

- never
Throws an error whenever a type is defined by this.

- undefined and null
Not have much use, unless strictNullChecks is used. typeof undefined is undefined and of null is object.
