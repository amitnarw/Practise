Union types are used when more then 1 type is used. We have to use | b/w parameters.

function name(val: string|number){
    console.log(val);
}

name(20) = 20
name('demo') = demo

- Errors in union type
function namE(val: string|number){
    console.log(val.toUpperCase());
}
Here it will show error, because both types should have this function. Here we can't use toUpperCase()
on a number.
