Hoisting = Process of moving declaration to the top of their block (during compilation phase), before running the code.
TDZ = Temporal Dead Zone is a zone where a variable declared with let, const or class stays untill it is initialized (meaning assigned a value). Gives ReferenceError if try to access. Helps in block scoping and prevent usage before properly initialized.

declaration (var a)
assignment (a = 3)
initialization = declaration + assignment
